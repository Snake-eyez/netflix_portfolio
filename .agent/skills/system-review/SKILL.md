# When To Use
Use this skill after completing an implementation to review the process and generate insights.

# Instructions
1. Read the generated plan and the execution report.
2. Analyze adherence to the plan and identify divergences.
3. Classify divergences (good vs. bad).
4. Generate a report with process improvement suggestions.

# Constraints
- Focus on process, not just code quality.
- Suggest concrete updates to docs or commands.
