# Goal
Create an atomic, well-labeled commit for current changes.

# When To Use
Use this skill when you have uncommitted changes that form a logical unit of work.

# Instructions
1. Check status and diff of uncommitted changes.
2. Add changed files.
3. Create a commit with a descriptive message and appropriate tag.

# Constraints
- Commits should be atomic.
- Use conventional commit tags (feat, fix, docs, etc.).

# Resources
