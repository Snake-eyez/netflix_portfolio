description: Create comprehensive feature plan with deep codebase analysis and research.
---

# Goal
Transform a feature request into a comprehensive implementation plan that enables one-pass implementation success.

# When To Use
Use this skill when you need to plan a new feature, refactor, or complex change before writing any code.

# Instructions
1. Analyze the feature request and user stories.
2. Gather codebase intelligence (structure, patterns, dependencies).
3. Conduct external research if needed.
4. Create a detailed implementation plan following the structure in `resources/plan-feature.md`.

# Constraints
- Do NOT write code in this phase.
- Ensure the plan is context-rich and executable.

# Resources
- [Feature Plan Template](resources/plan-feature.md)
