# Non-Professional Visual QA (Quick Pass)

Date: 2026-02-26

## Scope Checked
- Creative: Portfolio, Blogs, Workshops, Coming Soon
- Explorer: Movies, Reading, Resource Vault, Interactive Learning
- Visionary: Idea Lab, Methodology, Outstandr, Vision & Mission
- Explicitly excluded: Professional flow/pages

## Checklist
- [x] Shared visual system applied to all non-professional pages
- [x] Theme-specific identity active (Creative/Explorer/Visionary)
- [x] Card/CTA/button treatment coherent across pages
- [x] Micro-motion present and profile-specific
- [x] Reduced-motion fallback included
- [x] Mobile spacing and control polish applied (768px, 480px)
- [x] Obvious copy/encoding artifacts cleaned in key pages

## Tightening Changes Made
- Rewrote `Outstandr` copy for clarity and brand tone consistency.
- Removed malformed list bullets and typo artifacts in `Outstandr`.
- Removed emoji from `Reading` stats heading for cleaner Netflix-style tone.
- Replaced `color-mix`-dependent shadows in theme with stable accent glow vars.

## Validation
- `npm run build` passed.
